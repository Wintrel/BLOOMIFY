# **BLOOMIFY**
A rhythm game inspired by osu!mania with a chaotic twist.

## **About**
Bloomify is a rhythm game inspired by the popular title osu!mania, but with a chaotic twist. It takes the core concept of hitting notes in time with music, then adds a variety of playful and unpredictable mechanics that make gameplay fun and challenging.

If osu!mania is a perfectly choreographed stage, Bloomify is that stage with the floor spinning, lights flickering, and someone throwing confetti at you.

## **Features** (these features arent done yet)
Bloomify introduces several unique mechanics to keep you on your toes.

* Note Turners: Notes that smoothly rotate the entire playfield in one direction or another.

* Dynamic Lanes: Songs can add or remove lanes mid-game. You might start with 4 keys and suddenly find yourself with more.

* Multi Notes: Some notes need to be hit multiple times before they disappear.

* Fake Notes: Notes that vanish right before you attempt to hit them, testing your reflexes and anticipation.

* Lane Expansion: Lanes can widen or shrink, forcing you to adjust your accuracy in real-time.
